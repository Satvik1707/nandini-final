Womenswear collections inspired by the orchid mantis, mantids that use orchid
 camouflage to ambush prey. Their disguise is so effective that flying insects are
 more attracted to the mantis than the flowers they imitate. It inspired me to make
 a collection that plays with this beautiful predatorâ€™s ability to disguise itself and
 attract its prey. I used pleats and gathers to imitate the shapes of the orchid mantis
 body and cochineal natural dyes to ombre pieces to mimic the pink color of the
 mantis.
